/*
Madison County collects property taxes on the assessed value of property, which is 60% of its actual value. For example, if a house is valued at $158,000 its assessed value is $94,800. This is the amount the homeowner pays tax on. At last year's tax rate of $2.64 for each $100 of assessed value, the annual property tax for this house would be $2502.72. Write a program that asks the user to input the actual value of a piece of property and the current tax rate for each $100 of asessed value. The program should then calculate and report how much annual property tax the homeowner will be charged for this property.
