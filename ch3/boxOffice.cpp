/*
A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket sales. The remainder goes to the distributor. Write a program that calculates a theater's gross and net box office profit for a night. The program should ask for the name of the movie, and how many adult and child tickets were sold. (The price of an adult ticket is $6.00 and a childs ticket is $3.00) It should display a report similar to the following:

    Movie Name:                 "Wheels of Fury"
    Adult tickets sold:         382
    Child Tickets sold:         127
    Gross Box Office Profit:    $ 2673.00
    Amount Paid to Distr:      -$ 3138.40
    Net Box Office Profit:      $  534.60

Assume the theater keeps 20% of the gross box office profit.
