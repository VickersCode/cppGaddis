/*
Assuming there are no deposits other than the original investment, the balance in a savings account after one year may be calculated as 

                        Amount = Principal * (1 + Rate/T)^T

where Principal is the balance in the account, Rate is the annual interest rate, and T is the number of times the interest is compunded during a year. (e.g., T is 4 if the interest is compounded quarterly.)

Write a program that asks for the principal, the interest rate, and the number of times the interest is compounded. It should display a report similar to the following:

                Interest Rate:           4.25%
                Times Compounded:          12
                Principal:          $ 1000.00
                Interest:           $   43.33
                Final Balance:      $ 1043.33
